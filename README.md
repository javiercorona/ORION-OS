ORIONOS v4 – Quantum Citadel Edition
Quantum-Secure OS Platform | AI-Driven Threat Defense | Hardened for Modern Hardware

About:
ORIONOS v4 is a next-generation operating system designed for organizations and users demanding maximum security. It fuses quantum-resistant cryptography, advanced AI threat monitoring, and deep hardware integration (TPM/HSM/SGX) to create a true "Quantum Citadel" for your data and workloads.

Key Features
Quantum RNG
Harnesses quantum hardware entropy sources and TPM-backed randomness for all cryptographic operations.

Post-Quantum Cryptography
Implements Kyber1024 (KEM) and Dilithium5-AES (Signature), with hardware-accelerated key storage and rotation.

AI-Powered Threat Monitoring
Embedded AI model (TensorFlow Lite, hardware-secured) performs real-time anomaly detection, verified with hardware attestation.

Quantum Logger
Immutable, hash-chained logs with PQC signatures and TPM-backed attestation.

Dead Man’s Switch
Multi-factor, hardware-secured failsafe for rapid data destruction in the event of compromise.

Quantum Vault
Central core for key management, policy enforcement, and secure memory—all with enhanced kernel protections.

Hardened Boot & Runtime
Secure Boot detection, kernel lockdown, encrypted configs, and strict syscall hardening.
